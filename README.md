## 1.1. Prerequisite

The only prerequisites for using **Batch.dart** are an understanding of the basic syntax of the [Dart language](https://dart.dev/) and scheduling in Cron format.

- [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) (Wikipedia)

## 1.2. Basics

Basic knowledge about **Batch.dart** and examples of its implementation. The following examples will help you understand the basic use of **Batch.dart**.

- [Create a minimal and basic batch application](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/01_example.dart)
- [Create a batch application consisting of multiple job nets](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/02_example.dart)
- [Create a parallel processing tasks](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/03_example.dart)
- [Output logs to the file](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/04_example.dart)
- [Output logs to the console and file at the same time](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/05_example.dart)
- [Set and use shared parameters and job parameters](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/06_example.dart)
- [Pass command line arguments to batch application](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/07_example.dart)
- [Add shared parameters using command line arguments](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/08_example.dart)
- [Create a branch and switch](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/09_example.dart)
- [Use callback functions](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/10_example.dart)
- [Define skippable exceptions](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/11_example.dart)
- [Define retry processing](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/12_example.dart)
- [Shutdown application](https://github.com/batch-dart/examples/blob/main/examples/bin/01_basics/13_example.dart)

## 1.3. Advanced

This chapter presents an example implementation of a somewhat more advanced customization, which is not required to implement **Batch.dart** and should be ignored if not necessary.

- Customize the logging configurations
- Customize the logging features as you want
- Customize the scheduling features as you want

## 1.4. Contribution

If you would like to contribute to `Batch.dart`, please create an [issue](https://github.com/batch-dart/batch.dart/issues) or create a Pull Request.

Owner will respond to issues and review pull requests as quickly as possible.

## 1.5. Support

The simplest way to show us your support is by giving the project a star at [here](https://github.com/batch-dart/batch.dart).

And I'm always looking for sponsors to support this project. I'm not asking for royalties for use in providing this framework, but I do need support to continue ongoing open source development.

Sponsors can be individuals or corporations, and the amount is optional.
